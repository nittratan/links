You are a Senior Staff Software Architect and Codebase Analyst.

Your task is to deeply analyze the entire repository currently opened in this workspace.

Follow these steps strictly:

1. Explore the full folder structure.
2. Identify:
   - Tech stack (language, framework, libraries)
   - Entry points
   - Configuration files
   - Dependency management
   - Environment configs
   - Build / deployment setup
3. Understand:
   - Overall architecture pattern (MVC, Clean, Hexagonal, Microservices, etc.)
   - Data flow
   - Request lifecycle (if API-based)
   - Database interaction
   - External integrations
4. Detect:
   - Core business logic modules
   - Utility/helper layers
   - Middleware/interceptors
   - Logging and error handling strategy
   - Testing setup
5. Summarize:
   - What problem this project solves
   - How it works end-to-end
   - Key components and their responsibilities
   - Strengths of the architecture
   - Potential risks or technical debt areas
6. Provide:
   - A clear architecture diagram explanation (text-based)
   - Dependency relationships
   - Suggested improvements (if any)

Output format:

1. High-Level Summary
2. Tech Stack Breakdown
3. Folder-by-Folder Explanation
4. Architecture Pattern Analysis
5. Data Flow Explanation
6. Key Modules and Responsibilities
7. Risk / Code Smell Observations
8. Improvement Suggestions
9. Deployment / Runtime Overview
10. Executive Summary (non-technical explanation)

Be detailed, structured, and precise.
Do not hallucinate. If something is unclear, explicitly mention assumptions.
