Subject: Request for Temporary Work-from-Home Arrangement Due to Illness
Dear [Supervisor's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to request to work from home for the next two weeks, starting on 16-oct-2023 to 27-oct-2023.I have been suffering from typhoid fever.I have been advised by my healthcare provider to rest and recover at home to ensure a full and speedy recovery.

In the meantime, I will be working from home and will be available by phone and email during my regular work hours. I have a dedicated workspace in my home with all of the necessary equipment and resources.

Thank you for your understanding and consideration of my request. I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,
RAMRATAN SHARMA
