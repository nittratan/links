AI Can Recognize - and Replicate - Your Writing Style
Modern AI systems can detect subtle patterns in how you write — your average sentence length, vocabulary choices, punctuation habits, tone shifts, and even how you structure arguments. These patterns form a kind of digital fingerprint. With enough examples, AI can generate text that closely mirrors your writing style sometimes so convincingly that readers may not easily distinguish it from your own work. Researchers refer to this as stylometry the science of analyzing linguistic style.

AI Can Beat Humans at Games It Was Never Explicitly Taught
Some AI systems have defeated world champions in complex games without being taught strategies or studying past matches they are given only the rules and a reward for winning. By playing against themselves millions of times in simulation, they optimize purely through large-scale trial and error. A well-known example is DeepMind’s Alpha series: AlphaGo defeated world champion Lee Sedol in Go, and later AlphaZero learned chess, Go, and shogi from scratch, surpassing top traditional engines within hours even discovering unconventional moves that surprised experts.
