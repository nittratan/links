Developed and deployed an API endpoint to trigger batch jobs on-demand, automating the earlier cron-based process. This enhancement provided flexibility to QA teams for test execution, reducing dependency on scheduled triggers and significantly improving productivity and operational efficiency. Successfully implemented the job-trigger automation module, enabling on-demand testing workflows and smoother QA operations.
Optimized multiple SQL queries by restructuring joins and indexes, leading to faster execution time and improved system performance during batch processing and data retrieval. These optimizations reduced database load and enhanced overall system responsiveness and stability.
