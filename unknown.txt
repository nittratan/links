I want to grow into a role where I can contribute to end-to-end system design, large-scale data/AI pipelines, and high-impact engineering decisions. My key interest areas include:
Building scalable backend and cloud-native systems
Advancing skills in MLOps, including model deployment, monitoring, CI/CD for ML, and production RAG pipelines
Deepening expertise in GenAI, LLM integration, model optimization, and enterprise AI use cases
Designing production-ready data/feature pipelines for AI-driven products
Leading technical initiatives, mentoring team members, and improving engineering processes
Working on high-impact domains like payment integrity, claims intelligence, provider anomaly detection, and healthcare automation
I want to take more ownership in architecture, AI/ML deployment strategy, and long-term technical direction.
