Unit Test Document – Appeals ACK Sending (GB & CB)

Objective

To validate that the Appeals ACK is sent for both GB and CB cases, and to verify that the logs correctly capture the sending process.


---

Test Scope

System Under Test (SUT): Appeals ACK sending process

Trigger Type: Manual/Automated as per Appeals workflow

Log Monitoring: Application logs

Scope Includes: GB and CB flows



---

Test Steps

1. Initiate Appeals Flow

Trigger the appeals ACK process (as per functional flow: either via UI action, batch job, or API call).



2. Check Logs for GB Flow

Search application logs for GB appeal ACK entries.

Confirm that an ACK send log entry exists for GB.



3. Check Logs for CB Flow

Search application logs for CB appeal ACK entries.

Confirm that an ACK send log entry exists for CB.



4. Confirm ACK Sent for Both

Verify that ACK send confirmations exist for both GB and CB for the same test case / correlation ID.





---

Expected Results

Case	GB ACK Sent?	CB ACK Sent?	Expected Outcome

Positive	Yes	Yes	ACK successfully sent for both GB & CB
Negative	No	No	No ACK sent (system behaves as per fail scenario)



---

Pass/Fail Criteria

Pass: Logs confirm ACK sent for both GB and CB.

Fail: ACK sent for only one flow or not sent for both.



---

Test Evidence

Positive Case:

Screenshot of log showing GB ACK sent.

Screenshot of log showing CB ACK sent.


Negative Case:

Screenshot showing ACK not sent for both flows.




---

Remarks

Ensure test execution is done in an environment where both GB and CB data is available.

Use correlation IDs for matching GB and CB ACK events.

Attach all relevant log screenshots as evidence.

Bhai agar tum chaho to mai GB/CB dono ke liye side-by-side log verification ka format bana ke de sakta hoon taaki tumhare docs me ek hi table me proof aa jaye.
Woh tumhare screenshot ke saath kaafi professional lagega.
