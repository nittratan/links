Thik hai bhai, main tumhare liye clear aur professional style unit test documentation bana deta hoon jo tum apne work log ya Confluence/Jira me dal sakte ho.

Unit Test Document â€“ UPD ACK Sending to EXL

Objective

To validate that when the UPD ACK is successfully sent to EXL, the ed-api is immediately triggered in a subprocess, and when the UPD ACK is not sent, the ed-api trigger does not occur.


---

Test Scope

System Under Test (SUT): API Endpoint https://t.gcpdns.internal.das/taggin

Trigger Type: Manual/Automated via API call

Dependent Service: ed-api

Log Monitoring: Application logs



---

Test Steps

1. Trigger the API

Send a request to:

POST https://t.gcpdns.internal.das/taggin

Provide necessary payload & headers as per API specification.



2. Check UPD ACK Sending

Open application logs in the respective logging tool (e.g., Kibana/Stackdriver).

Search for log entry confirming UPD ACK sent to EXL.



3. Verify ed-api Trigger (Positive Case)

If UPD ACK sent is confirmed:

Check logs for immediate subprocess call to ed-api.

Match the correlation ID / request ID with the initial trigger.




4. Verify No ed-api Trigger (Negative Case)

If UPD ACK is not sent:

Ensure no subprocess trigger for ed-api exists for the same correlation ID.






---

Expected Results

Case	UPD ACK Sent?	ed-api Trigger?	Expected Outcome

Positive	Yes	Yes	ed-api triggered immediately
Negative	No	No	No ed-api trigger



---

Pass/Fail Criteria

Pass: Behavior matches the expected results in both positive and negative cases.

Fail: ed-api triggers without UPD ACK sent OR UPD ACK sent but no ed-api trigger occurs.



---

Test Evidence

Positive Case:

Screenshot of log showing UPD ACK sent.

Screenshot of log showing immediate ed-api subprocess trigger.


Negative Case:

Screenshot showing UPD ACK not sent.

Screenshot showing absence of any ed-api subprocess trigger.




---

Remarks

Ensure both test cases are executed on the same environment.

Maintain correlation ID mapping for traceability.

Attach log screenshots as evidence.

Bhai agar tum bolo to main iska ready-made Jira ticket format me bhi likh ke de sakta hoon taaki tum sidha copy-paste kar sako.
Isme test case IDs aur evidence placeholders bhi dal dunga.
