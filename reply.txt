You can respond with something formal and safe, without committing to a demo:

"As the data setup is currently in SIT, a comprehensive demo might not be feasible at this stage. However, I am available to address any queries or provide necessary details regarding the implementation. Let me know how you’d like to proceed."

This keeps it professional while avoiding any direct commitment to a demo or walkthrough.






Hey team, I won’t be able to join today’s scrum.

Subject: Unavailability on Monday Evening

Hi [Recipient's Name],

I wanted to inform you that I have a train to my hometown on Monday, 14th April, around 6:00 PM. Therefore, I will be unavailable after 5:00 PM that day.

I have already closed my story today, and I do not have any planned leaves for the upcoming days.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,
[Your Name]


As of now, our team hasn’t received the finalized details regarding the specific PostgreSQL tables or schema for the table audit-type files. Once we get the confirmation on the structure, especially for fields like fileStatus, we’ll be able to share the exact references for the landing page implementation.
