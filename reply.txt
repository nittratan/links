You can respond with something formal and safe, without committing to a demo:

"As the data setup is currently in SIT, a comprehensive demo might not be feasible at this stage. However, I am available to address any queries or provide necessary details regarding the implementation. Let me know how you’d like to proceed."

This keeps it professional while avoiding any direct commitment to a demo or walkthrough.
